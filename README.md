# Bertie690/dotfiles

A repository containing various dotfiles and config files.

Partially inspired by https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/'s extension-based approach mixed with my own insane lust for organization, this dotfile repo is designed to be fully configurable out of the gate - nearly everything can be customized to suit one's demands.

# Installation/Usage

Requires Bash 4.4 or greater to make use of `readarray`.

Clone the repository, tweak the settings in [bootstrap.config](./scripts/bootstrap.config) to your liking, then run [bootstrap.sh](./scripts/bootstrap.sh).

All behavior can be fully customized.
